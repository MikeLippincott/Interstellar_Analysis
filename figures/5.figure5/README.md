# Generating publication ready figures from the data

## Before you start
Before running the scripts, to generate figure5, we ran imageJ macros to adjust the lookup tables of each image.

Those macros can be found under the folder `figures/5.figure5/imageJ_macros/`.

Please run the macros before running the scripts.

Please note that we used version 1.54f of imageJ.
