# Generating publication ready figures from the data

## Before you start
Before running the scripts, to generate figure5, we ran imageJ macros to adjust the lookup tables of each image.

Those macros can be found under the folder `figures/5.figure5/imageJ_macros/`.

Please run the macros before running the scripts.

Please note that we used version 1.54f of imageJ.

Open FIJI and drag and drop the macro file into the FIJI window.
Then click on `Run` and the macro will run.
The macro is written for user interface and will ask you to specify the input and output folders.
