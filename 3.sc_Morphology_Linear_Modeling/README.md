## Linear Modeling of CellProfiler features to understand differences between treatments and control.

Fit a series of linear models (one per feature) to determine which features contribute the most to the differences between treatments and controls (highest beta coefficients) adjusting for cell count per well.

A couple of models are used to determine feature variance and the condition's contribution to the variance.

# The Models:

for each linear model,
$y$ is each feature
$x$ is the inputed variables
$\epsilon$ is the residual variance not explained by factors in the model

## Linear Model a :
$y = \beta _{0}x+ \beta _{1}x+ \beta _{2}x+ \beta _{3}x+ \beta _{4}x+ \epsilon$ \
where;
$\beta _{0}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to cell count.
$\beta _{1}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inducer, Inducer Dose, Inhibitor, and Inhibitor Dose.


## Linear Model b:
$y = \beta _{0}x+ \beta _{1}x+ \beta _{2}x+ \beta _{3}x+ \beta _{4}x+ \epsilon$ \
where;
$\beta _{0}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to cell count.
$\beta _{1}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inducer, Inhibitor, and Inhibitor Dose.
$\beta _{2}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inducer dose.

## Linear Model c:
$y = \beta _{0}x+ \beta _{1}x+ \beta _{2}x+ \beta _{3}x+ \beta _{4}x+ \epsilon$ \
where;
$\beta _{0}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to cell count.
$\beta _{1}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inducer.
$\beta _{2}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inducer dose.
$\beta _{3}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inhibitor, and Inhibitor Dose.

## Linear Model d:
$y = \beta _{0}x+ \beta _{1}x+ \beta _{2}x+ \beta _{3}x+ \beta _{4}x+ \epsilon$ \
where;
$\beta _{0}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to cell count.
$\beta _{1}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inducer.
$\beta _{2}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inducer dose.
$\beta _{3}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inhibitor.
$\beta _{4}$ is the beta coefficient attributed to Inhibitor Dose.
