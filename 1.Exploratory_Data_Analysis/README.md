# This folder hosts jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) for multiple 'waves' of data. See this repo's main page for a link to the Interstellar preprocessing page.

Where 'waves' of data are data from the same plate but using different channels for different analysis such as wavelength bleed through or antibody validation.

```Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb```
is for clustering of cells across all features. The goal is to aim to see if treatments cluster or not.
```cell_count_analysis.ipynb``` is for qc analysis to assess if there are cell count drop offs for a given treatment.

All figures are saved under `Figures` folder.
