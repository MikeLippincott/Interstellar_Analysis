# This folder hosts jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) for multiple 'waves' of data. See this repo's main page for a link to the Interstellar preprocessing page.

```Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb```
is for clustering cells across all features. The goal is to aim and see if the treatments cluster or not.
```cell_count_analysis.ipynb``` is for qc analysis to assess if there are cell count drop offs for a given treatment.

All figures are saved under `Figures` folder.
