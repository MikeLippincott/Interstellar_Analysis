# Morphological features Predict Secretome Protein Abundance via Elastic Net

Here we show that morphological features can be used to predict the abundance of secretome proteins in a cell. We use the [elastic net](https://towardsdatascience.com/ridge-lasso-and-elasticnet-regression-b1f9c00ea3a3) algorithm to predict the abundance of secretome proteins in a cell.
