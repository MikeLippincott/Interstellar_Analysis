# Preprocess Data

Here we preprocess the data to be used in the model. 
The data is stored in the `data` folder.
The data is preprocessed in the following steps:

1. Morphology preprocessing
    Here we clean the morphoplogical data and metadata.
2. nELISA (Secretome) preprocessing
    Here we clean the nELISA data and metadata.
3. Aggregation and Merging
    Here we aggregate the morphology data to the well level and merge it with the nELISA data.
